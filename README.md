# fcc-houston-aws
Workshop on AWS for FreeCodeCamp in Houston

For our meetup on Friday, Feb. 13 2017, I will cover the basics of Amazon Web Services S3. You will learn how to host your front-end web project on the S3 service. 

This repository will hold some example projects, data files, and image files that I'll use to demonstrate deployment to S3. 
To get the most out of the workshop, I recommend bringing your own project to deploy.

If you haven't done them yet, I recommend completing either of the Basic Front-End Web Development Projects on FreeCodeCamp and deploying them during the workshop.
* [Build a tribute page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page)
* [Build a personal portfolio page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

#Agenda
* Setup an S3 bucket on AWS
* Loading your front-end web project onto S3.
* Viewing and sharing your project using an AWS endpoint, such as [space.ct7.io.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](https://space.ct7.io.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
